# Helium Frontend

Folder Structure:

- All the frontend components lies inside the `ui` folder
- The Frontend is developed by keeping in mind the Atomic Design Principles
- The Backend API calls are in the `ui/organisms/MainSection.jsx` file

Note: Currently the UI is fairly simple, though for ease to develop more pages in future, Atomic Design is used.

Frontend UI/UX is inspired from [LZ-String Demo](https://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/demo.html)

Frontend is also hosted on heroku
